 Hello, I've created this website as an optional side hustle to think about to kill many birds with one stone. I have a growing passio for dogs and have a lot of emotions for them in general. Also have a driving curiousity on the many different breeds there are and how their personalities are. The one bird I want to 'kill' the most would be to have many playdates for the second owner of this business, Bella.

Here are the pictures to my website:

One pretty cool piece of HTML & CSS that I wrote was my navigation bar:
<nav class="navbar">
    <div class="logo">Paws&Paul</div>
       <ul class="nav-links">  
          <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox_toggle">
          <label for="checkbox_toggle" class="hamburger">&#9776;</label>
          
          
        <div class="menu">
        
            <li><a href="/index.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services.html">Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="/user-registration.html">Register</a></li>
            <li><a href="/user-login.html">Login</a></li>
            <li><a href="/checkout.html" class="fa-solid fa-cart-shopping"></a></li>
        </div>
      </ul>
  </nav>
  
Although it is pretty basic, I thought the process was cool and was able to play around with it and make it fully functional!
